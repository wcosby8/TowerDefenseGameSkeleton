/*
This class is responsible for managing a pool of reusable game objects, allowing for efficient 
spawning and despawning of objects without the overhead of instantiating and destroying them repeatedly.

The idea here is that when we need a new enemy, we activate an inactive enemy from the pool instead of 
creating a new one. When an enemy is no longer needed (e.g., when it reaches the end of the path or is 
destroyed), we can simply deactivate it and return it to the pool for future use. This approach can help 
improve performance by reducing the number of instantiations and destructions, which can be costly operations
in Unity.
